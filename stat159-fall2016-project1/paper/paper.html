<p>The <strong>main objective</strong> of this paper is to introduce the <em>computational tools</em>, such as bash, markdown, pandoc, git, github, and Make. There will be comments on each tool, and explanation of what role it plays in the process of writing a paper. In order to fulfill the main objective, I focus on answering the following bullet-points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain what is a Makefile and the role it plays in this reproducible workflow.</li>
<li>Explain what is Git, and its role in this reproducible workflow.</li>
<li>Explain what is GitHub, and its role in this project.</li>
<li>Explain what is pandoc, and comment on its usefulness (or advantages).</li>
<li>Explain what is Markdown.</li>
<li>What resources you used to get the job done?</li>
<li>What were the &quot;easy&quot; parts?</li>
<li>What were the challenging parts?</li>
<li>What things you were stuck with?</li>
<li>What was the most time consuming part?</li>
<li>Did you work with and/or get help from someone else? If yes, in what manner?</li>
<li>How much time did it take?</li>
</ul>
