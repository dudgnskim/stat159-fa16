### **ABSTRACT**
The **main objective** of this paper is to introduce the _computational tools_, such as bash, markdown, pandoc, git, github, and Make. There will be comments on each tool, and explanation of what role it plays in the process of writing a paper. In order to fulfill the main objective, I focus on answering the following bullet-points:

* Explain what is a Makefile and the role it plays in this reproducible workflow.
* Explain what is Git, and its role in this reproducible workflow.
* Explain what is GitHub, and its role in this project.
* Explain what is pandoc, and comment on its usefulness (or advantages).
* Explain what is Markdown.
* What resources you used to get the job done?
* What were the "easy" parts?
* What were the challenging parts?
* What things you were stuck with?
* What was the most time consuming part?
* Did you work with and/or get help from someone else? If yes, in what manner?
* How much time did it take?

### **1. INTRODUCTION**

_Why is 'Reproducible Research' so important to so many people in modern era?_ Before discussing all the tools that brought about the era of reproducible research, we should understand, and be able to answer the question above. Consider why it exists, and why it is done. Reproducible research is, as described in its name, a research that individuals, in addition to the authors, can recreate all of the *computations* described in a body of work. From the definition, we could reach the conclusion that reproducible research exists and is conducted in order to show evidence or the author's work's correctness as well as to enable others to make use of the methods and results.

The principles of reproducible research  are the following:

* traditional unit of scholarly communication - a published article - is only the tip of the iceberg of the research process
* To expose more of the research workflow to our audience.
* Makes it easier for them to make a more informed assessment of our methods and results
* Makes it easier for them to adapt our methods to their own research.
