### **1. INTRODUCTION**

_Why is 'Reproducible Research' so important to so many people in modern era?_ Before discussing all the tools that brought about the era of reproducible research, we should understand, and be able to answer the question above. Consider why it exists, and why it is done. Reproducible research is, as described in its name, a research that individuals, in addition to the authors, can recreate all of the *computations* described in a body of work. From the definition, we could reach the conclusion that reproducible research exists and is conducted in order to show evidence or the author's work's correctness as well as to enable others to make use of the methods and results.

The principles of reproducible research  are the following:

* Traditional unit of scholarly communication - a published article - is only the tip of the iceberg of the research process
* To expose more of the research workflow to our audience.
* Makes it easier for them to make a more informed assessment of our methods and results
* Makes it easier for them to adapt our methods to their own research.
