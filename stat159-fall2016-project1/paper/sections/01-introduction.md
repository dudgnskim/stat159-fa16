### **1. INTRODUCTION**

_Why is 'Reproducible Research' so important to so many people in modern era?_ Before discussing all the tools that brought about the heyday of reproducible research, we should understand, and be able to answer the question above. Consider why it exists, and why it is done. Reproducible research is, as described in its name, a research that individuals, in addition to the authors, can recreate all of the *computations* described in a body of work. From the definition, we could reach the conclusion that reproducible research exists and is conducted in order to show evidence or the author's work's correctness as well as to enable others to make use of the methods and results.

The principles of reproducible research are the following:

* Traditional unit of scholarly communication (e.g. a published article) is only the tip of the iceberg of the research process
* Increase exposure of the research workflow to the audience.
* Provide accessibility for the audience to make a more informed assessment of the methods and results
* Make it easier for the readers to adapt the methods to their own research.

In order to achieve computational reproducibility, various software tools are developed. I intend to introduce and discuss about them from the next section.
