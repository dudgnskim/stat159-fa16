#### **ABSTRACT**
The **main objective** of this paper is to introduce the _computational tools_, such as bash, markdown, pandoc, git, github, and Make. There will be comments on each tool, and explanation of what role it plays in the process of writing a paper. In order to fulfill the main objective, I focus on answering the following bullet-points:

* Explain what is a Makefile and the role it plays in this reproducible workflow.
* Explain what is Git, and its role in this reproducible workflow.
* Explain what is GitHub, and its role in this project.
* Explain what is pandoc, and comment on its usefulness (or advantages).
* Explain what is Markdown.
* What resources you used to get the job done?
* What were the "easy" parts?
* What were the challenging parts?
* What things you were stuck with?
* What was the most time consuming part?
* Did you work with and/or get help from someone else? If yes, in what manner?
* How much time did it take?
